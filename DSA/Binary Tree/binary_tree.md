## Tips for Solving Binary Tree Problems
1. **Understand Traversals**: Practice preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals. These are fundamental for tree problems.
2. **Learn Recursion**: Most tree problems are naturally recursive.
3. **Use Iterative Methods**: Sometimes iterative solutions (using stacks or queues) are necessary, especially in traversal problems.
4. **Focus on Properties**: For advanced problems, understand properties like height, symmetry, and ancestor relationships.
