Here are the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) broken down into common categories, along with some examples:

### 1. **Data Structures**

- **Arrays**
  - Fixed-size container storing elements of the same type.
  - Operations: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching.

- **Linked Lists**
  - Sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.
  - Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
  - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Searching.

- **Stacks**
  - LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
  - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
  - Use Cases: Expression evaluation, Backtracking.

- **Queues**
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
  - Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.
  - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek.
  - Use Cases: Task scheduling, Buffer management.

- **Trees**
  - Hierarchical data structure with nodes.
  - Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Trees, Heap.
  - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).

- **Graphs**
  - Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
  - Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.
  - Representations: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix.
  - Operations: Traversal (DFS, BFS), Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree.

- **Hash Tables**
  - Key-value data structure with fast access times.
  - Operations: Insert, Search, Delete.
  - Collision Handling: Chaining, Open Addressing.

### 2. **Algorithms**

- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort

- **Recursion**
  - Method where a function calls itself.
  - Use Cases: Factorial, Fibonacci, Towers of Hanoi, Backtracking.

- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Optimization technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down.
  - Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Matrix Chain Multiplication.

- **Greedy Algorithms**
  - Makes optimal choices at each step.
  - Examples: Fractional Knapsack, Activity Selection, Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path.

- **Backtracking**
  - Builds solutions incrementally and abandons them if they arenâ€™t feasible.
  - Examples: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum Problem.

- **Divide and Conquer**
  - Divides the problem into subproblems, solves them independently, and combines them.
  - Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Closest Pair of Points.

### 3. **Commonly Used Techniques**

- **Two-Pointer Technique** - Efficiently process elements in pairs or subsets of an array.
- **Sliding Window Technique** - Optimized way to find a subarray or substring with specific properties.
- **Binary Search on Answer** - Solving optimization problems by binary search on a sorted range.
