    - **Why Practice**: Tests advanced pointer manipulation and recursion.
3. [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)
    - **Description**: Create a deep copy of a linked list where each node has a random pointer.
    - **Why Practice**: Tests cloning logic and pointer management.
4. [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
    - **Description**: Find the node where a cycle begins in a linked list.
    - **Why Practice**: Extends Floyd's cycle detection to pinpoint the starting node.
5. [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)
    - **Description**: Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a doubly linked list and a hashmap.
    - **Why Practice**: Combines linked lists with other data structures and is commonly asked in system design interviews.
