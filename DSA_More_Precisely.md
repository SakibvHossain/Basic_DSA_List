# DSA Preparation Sequence for Software Engineering Interviews

## Preparation Sequence for DSA

### 1. Foundation Phase: Basics of Programming
- Start with **basic programming concepts** if you're new to coding:
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Conditionals and loops
  - Functions and recursion
  - Basic I/O operations
- **Language Focus:** As you're using Java, get comfortable with Java syntax and features.

---

### 2. Linear Data Structures (Easy to Moderate Difficulty)
#### Arrays and Strings
- **Practice:** Traversals, prefix sums, sliding window technique, two-pointer technique.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Find duplicates in an array.  
  - Longest substring without repeating characters.  

#### Linked List
- **Practice:** Insertion, deletion, and reversal.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Detect and remove a cycle in a linked list.  
  - Merge two sorted linked lists.  

#### Stacks and Queues
- **Practice:** Implement stack/queue using an array or linked list.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Evaluate postfix expressions.  
  - Next greater element.  

---

### 3. Algorithms: Searching and Sorting
#### Binary Search
- **Practice:** Applications like rotated arrays, search in 2D matrix.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Find the square root of a number.  
  - Search an element in a rotated sorted array.  

#### Sorting Algorithms
- **Focus:** Quick Sort, Merge Sort (divide and conquer), Counting Sort.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s.  
  - Find the Kth largest element.

---

### 4. Non-Linear Data Structures (Moderate to Hard Difficulty)
#### Trees
- **Practice:** Traversals (recursive and iterative).  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Check if a tree is balanced.  
  - Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.  

#### Graphs
- **Focus:** BFS, DFS, and graph representation techniques.  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Detect cycles in an undirected graph.  
  - Find shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.  

---

### 5. Recursion and Backtracking
- Master recursion by solving simple problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).  
- Move to backtracking problems like N-Queens and Sudoku Solver.  

---

### 6. Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Start with 1D problems (Fibonacci, climbing stairs).  
- Progress to 2D problems (Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication).  
- **Example Problems:**  
  - Subset sum problem.  
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence.  

---

### 7. Advanced Topics
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Auto-complete, searching word prefixes.  
- **Segment Tree and Fenwick Tree:** Range queries.  
- **Union-Find:** Cycle detection in graphs, Kruskal’s algorithm.

---

## Daily Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundations
- Learn and practice arrays, strings, basic recursion.  
- Solve 5-6 easy problems daily.  

### Week 3-4: Linear DS
- Focus on linked lists, stacks, and queues.  
- Solve medium-level problems.  

### Week 5-6: Algorithms
- Master binary search and sorting algorithms.  
- Start solving graph problems (BFS/DFS).  

### Week 7-8: Non-Linear DS + Advanced Topics
- Work on trees and graphs.  
- Begin with dynamic programming problems.  

---

## Consistency Plan
1. **Solve Problems Daily:** Start with 2-3 easy problems, then move to 1-2 medium problems.
2. **Focus on Weak Areas:** Revisit topics that seem hard.  
3. **Mock Interviews:** Regularly take mock tests to simulate interview conditions.

## Resources to Use

### Platforms for Practice
- LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and CodeChef.  

### Books
- *"Introduction to Algorithms"* by Cormen (CLRS)  
- *"Cracking the Coding Interview"* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell  

### Java-Specific Resources
- Learn how to use Java’s **Stream API** for functional programming while solving problems.  
- Use `PriorityQueue` for heap-based problems.
